    "segmenting an image means partitioning an image into different regions of homogenous pixels such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- union of all regions = the image\n",
    "- each region is homogeneous. homogeneity can be based on criteria based on the problem one is trying to solve.\n",
    "- any pair of distinct regions is not homogeneous\n",
    "- regions shuld have low internal variance\n",
    "- regions should be made of spatially contiguous pixels\n",
