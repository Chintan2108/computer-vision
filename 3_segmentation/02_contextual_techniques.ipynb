    "# Contextual Image Segmentation Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "In dicussion so far we have seen segmentation which work on a global parameter (example: threshold) derived from an image. But there is another set of techniques which are more sophisticated than non-contextual techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "This sophistication comes from the context these techniques bring into the approach. These techniques have shown to yield more refined segements as compared to non-contextual techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, they also have their fare share of issues. Let's have a look at these techniques. We will not be looking at the implementation of these techniques but we will be discussing them briefly.\n",
